# BloomingUi

**BloomingUi** is an Angular project that leverages **Standalone Modules** and **Tailwind CSS** to simplify and optimize application development. This project was generated using the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Overview

**BloomingUi** is designed as a modern Angular application that utilizes Standalone Modules for a more streamlined module structure, reducing the complexity traditionally associated with NgModules. Additionally, the project integrates **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling that enables efficient design and responsive layouts. This architecture delivers faster load times, a maintainable codebase, and a flexible styling system.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/cli) installed globally via npm:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) dependencies (these will be installed as part of the project setup)

---

## Development Server

To start a local development server and run the application, execute:

```bash
ng serve
```

After running the command, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The application will automatically reload if you change any source files.

---

## Building the Application

To compile your project and generate the production-ready files, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This command compiles the project and stores the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. The production build is optimized for performance and speed.

---

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, run:

```bash
ng test
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, execute:

```bash
ng e2e
```

*Note:* Angular CLI does not include an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can integrate your preferred e2e framework as needed.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

BloomingUi integrates Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling. The following steps outline how Tailwind CSS is set up in this project:

1. **Installation:**  
   Tailwind CSS, along with its dependencies, is installed via npm. If you need to set it up manually, run:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

2. **Configuration:**  
   A `tailwind.config.js` file is created and configured to scan your Angular templates and TypeScript files for class names:

   ```js
   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{html,ts}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

3. **Including Tailwind in Your Styles:**  
   In your global styles file (usually `src/styles.css`), import Tailwindâ€™s base, components, and utilities:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

With these configurations, Tailwind CSS is fully integrated into BloomingUi, enabling you to use its utility classes across your application.

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI provides powerful code scaffolding tools to generate new components, directives, pipes, and more. For example, to generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics, execute:

```bash
ng generate --help
```
